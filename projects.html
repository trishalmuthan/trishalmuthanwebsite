                ProtestFind is an online service that allows people to create and join peaceful protests throughout the country. Once your account is created by providing an email, username, and password, you are able to create and join protests. You may create a new protest by providing a location or join a protest by finding a location near you, and clicking the join button. The number of people participating in a certain protest will be shown to the side of each available protest. We are currently in one of the darker times in our country’s history. By using ProtestFind and effectively organizing peaceful protests, we will be one big step closer to causing real change. And we are long due for some change.
